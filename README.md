This repository has code that calculates the time-dependent reduced density matrix for a spin boson model 
from J. Chem. Phys. 150, 034101 (2019) [Model 2 in the paper] using the Generalized Quantum Master Equation
method. 

In this method the F kernal and the auxilliary F-kernal is calculated using LSC-IVR. These are then used to 
calculate the memory kernal (K), which inturn is used to propagate the reduced density matrix.
